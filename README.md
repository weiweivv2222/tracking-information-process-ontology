# üß≤ Tracking Information Process Ontology

[![Update documentation website](https://github.com/weiweivv2222/tracking-information-process-ontology/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weiweivv2222/tracking-information-process-ontology/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

A repository to publish documentation for the **Tracking Information Process Ontology**.

The ontology is built using WebProt√©g√©.

‚ôªÔ∏è The documentation website hosted at [weiweivv2222.github.io/tracking-information-process-ontology](https://weiweivv2222.github.io/tracking-information-process-ontology) is automatically updated by a GitHub Action at every change to the ontology file.

## üìñ Generate the docs locally

<details><summary>Make sure Java ~17 and python >=3.8 are installed. We recommend to enable a python virtual environment.</summary>

Create the virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n tip
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate tip
```
</details>

Install the dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

Build the docs:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

Start a web server to check the generated docs:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

> Obviously this will not work on Windows since Windows are not real computers, you will need a real computer supporting Unix and Bash to do some computing work. And since MacBooks have literally a phone chip (M1/M2), their not computers anymore. So you will need the only real computer in the world: Linux (or enable WSL on Windows, or use docker)

## Generate RDF with python

Create and activate a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n tip
conda activate tip
```

Go to the mappings folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd mappings
pip install -e .
```

Run the script:

```bash
python event_mappings.py
```

## Execute RML mappings

> Not really used

1. Go to mappings folder

```bash
cd mappings
```

2. Convert the YARRRML mappings to RML, and generate the RDF from RML mappings:

```bash
python -m yatter -i event-mappings.yml -o event-mappings.rml.ttl
java -jar rmlmapper.jar -m event-mappings.rml.ttl -o output.ttl -s turtle
```
